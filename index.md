# Research

Thank you for visting my website. My name is Derrek Perham and I am a Systems Design's PhD student at The University of New Hampshire. 

The focus of my disertation is to have a regenerative and ridgid formation of AUVs follow a preset script of directions while communicating via short ranged underwater optical wireless communications.
